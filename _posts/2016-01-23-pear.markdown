Asterix is a single page application made with Angular.js and Near Earth Objects NASA API. It is a data visualisation of asteroids in space, currently in Earth's orbit. The site is automatically updated daily, through the API to show the most 7 day forecast of the asteroid's orbiting information such as size and velocity. This is a project borne out of my interest in space the lack of easy to understand information available online to learn more about our solar system.
